vegeo.js enables creation of blazing fast web sites, so called Single Page Application (SPA) web sites, resulting with better user experience.

<strong>vegeo.js</strong> operates without any framework dependencies.

<strong>vegeo.js</strong> comes in two versions using:
- pure JavaScript with Ajax as well as History API
or,
- jQuery with jQuery.ajax  as well as History API

By the combination of above mentioned programming techniques, <strong>vegeo.js</strong> enables creation of web sites with following advantages:
-	Once the initial page is loaded, any following web page is handled without full page reload, resulting with much faster load time than “normal” web sites. Depending on a web site design, increase of the web page loading speed can be well over 30%;
-	when browser caching occurs, that’s to say load of a page content is cached in memory, content is retrieved without any additional request and load speed is instant, i.e. measuring only several milliseconds; 
-	all these resulting with a far better user experience ;
-	less requests to the server.

Notice:
vegeo.js is not a so called single page – single page technique where the entire web site is loaded on the initial page load (resulting with a much longer loading time), and where web pages are loaded as a horizontal or vertical slides using internal anchors.
